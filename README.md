# Compueter vision
 
In this repository, we present a project on OCR developed with two different methods. 
The first one is called probabilistic and developed on Matlab. 
The second one is developed with a machine learning algorithm. 
In the end, the two results are compared and a study on the state of the art is presented.

Developed togheder with Francesco Nicolini.
